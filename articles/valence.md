"Valence" may seem more complicated than it is. In short, it refers to how "good" or "bad" an experience is. Positive valence means pleasurable, negative valence means painful.

So, why borrow a fancy word from chemistry for a simple concept? Well, there are two reasons:
- We want to use terms that are already accepted [by the broader community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valence_(psychology))
- We need a term for the spectrum that pleasure and pain both fall on so that we can make charts ([like the Qualia Research Institute has done](https://qri.org/blog/symmetry-theory-of-valence-2020)) 

Now, let's explore why "valence" means what it means. 

First, recall how valence shells work in chemistry ("valence shells" being the rings around in atom in the diagram you're about to see). All that matters for the metaphor is that **some valence shells attract and others repel**. Specifically, attraction happens when two atoms can complete their valence shells by sharing electrons:

So, the state of an atoms valence determines whether it is attractive. Similarly, the state of an experience's valence determines whether it is attractive. For example, let's say you can have an experience that'll give you pleasure. Then, you will want it:

On the other hand, if an experience will cause you pain, you will not want it. In fact, you probably want to actively avoid it:

So, experiences (or qualia) with a positive valence attract you while experiences with a negative valence repel you. Makes sense, right?

### So what?
Pleasure and pain are some of the most fundamental things we all claim to experience. By placing them on a spectrum, we can think about desire and disgust with more nuance. For example, someone who is currently extremely happy, maybe even manic, may think the idea of gratitude is disgusting in the moment. Say you've just received a standing ovation for achieving your wildest dreams and your on your way to a party. If someone told you to stop and calm down and focus on the little things and to stay grounded, you might be repulsed by the idea of setting aside your moment of glory to meditate or whatever. 

Alternatively, lets say you're depressed and lonely. You may feel weak and tell yourself you'd settle for anyone for a partner, even someone you have no chemistry with, so long as you're not alone anymore. 

In both situations, there's a surprising outcome. In the first, a pleasurable experience is still repulsive. In the second, a painful experience seems attractive. That's because the direction from where you are on the line and where you're imagining dictates whether you want it or not.

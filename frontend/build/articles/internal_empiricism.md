When it comes to devising strategies for making sense of the world, science and mathematics are focused on empirical or analytical strategies. This is to say that they like conclusions that are derived from measurable observations, or conclusions derived from an extremely rigorous set of axioms and actions (math and logic). One happens in your head. One happens outside your head. But, both can be verified outside of your head. 

I’d like to broaden our methods by proposing that we don’t just focus on observing things that are measurable using physical tools. I know that we can observe our own qualia. That’s what metaqualia is, and as I’ve established, most qualia is metaqualia. So, it follows that if we can put names to certain patterns of metaqualia and then compare these descriptions with eachother, we can get somewhere. Perhaps you agree with some of what I’ve said about protoqualia, metaqualia, or curation. Maybe you agree with all of it, or maybe it’s all garbage to you. 

**I don’t know** whether other people will relate to this. I need your feedback though. We all need it, because we can use it. We can achieve a lot more in the study of consciousness if we start to embrace some of this and make a new system for working on the qualia problem.

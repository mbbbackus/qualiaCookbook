Protoqualia refers to qualia that map directly to the homunculus. If you don’t know, the homunculus is a visual model of a human body that has been warped so that highly sensitive areas are larger then less sensitive parts. So, the eyes, ears, nose, mouth, hand, and reproductive parts are all very large, while the limbs and abdomen are much smaller. If you google it, you may find yourself creeped out. So, just think about the basic five sense: sight/smell/sound/touch/taste

The purpose of this term is to categorize “simple” qualia, such as red, the note A#, the smell of lavender, the taste of chocolate, the feeling of a hot shower, and more. Each of those qualia can be mapped to a body part. A sense organ. Eyes, ears, nose, mouth, skin, etc. The alternative to this is metaqualia.

To wrap up the concept, lets just talk about some basic experiences. In the diagram below, you'll see a simple square of solid red. As you look at it, you are experiencing a very simple protoqualia: red. Next, we have music, and chocolate cake.

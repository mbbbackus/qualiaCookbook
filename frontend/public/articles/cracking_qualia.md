First of all, if you don't know what qualia is:

<Nest>üë©‚Äçüî¨ What is Qualia?|qualia<Nest>

## How do we crack it?

What does it mean to crack it? Well, we know qualia exists. We have plenty examples of it. But, we have no idea how it connects to ‚Äúthe real world‚Äù. The physical world. We have no idea what creates qualia, or how. We have no idea how to share it, or if thats possible. These are some of the issues we ought to explore, just to start.

This has been called ‚Äúthe hard problem of consciousness‚Äù by David Chalmers. That name is, perhaps, an understatement. My philosophy professors generally told me that this problem is impossible. As did my peers. As have I believed, on occasion. 

Many of my conversations about qualia overloaded my brain until I just wanted to watch dumb youtube videos and eat chips in bed. 

It‚Äôs hard to wrap your head around itself.

However, there are other opinions. In the world of artificial intelligence, prominent figures in AI and AI alignment (such as Sam Altman and Eliezer Yudkowsky) tend to believe that an AI will simply generate qualia one day once its programming is complex enough. Meanwhile, the Qualia Research Institute (led by **[Andr√©s G√≥mez Emilsson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andr%C3%A9s-g%C3%B3mez-emilsson-b3084539))** holds that Qualia is a byproduct of the way our brains interact with electric fields. Alternatively, one of the most academically respected opinions would be that of Daniel Dennett, who contends that qualia is not real. He argues it‚Äôs an illusion and that we‚Äôre distracting ourselves by getting into this.

I could dissect and debate these arguments, but I won‚Äôt, because I believe that‚Äôd be less interesting than what I have to say. 

I think it‚Äôs possible to crack qualia. I think it‚Äôs possible, but not with machine learning, nor with brain surgery, nor magic. But, to be clear: I have not cracked qualia. I still don‚Äôt have the answers to any of the questions I raised. I have a new idea for how to get them though. I believe our minds are currently incapable of figuring out how qualia works. But, we can massage and sculpt our minds into ones that can. To do that, we can use language. 

## Linguistic Engineering

Did you know that Russian-speakers can see blue better than English speakers? Russian has more words for different shades of blue, therefore Russian speakers have an advantage at differentiating those shades of blue. Famously, the blockbuster movie *Arrival* (based on a story by Ted Chiang) uses a similar premise for its story‚Äìspoiler incoming‚Äìwhere an alien species teaches humanity a language which is atemporal, so it enables its speakers to experience reality in four dimensions, such that time is simultaneous.

This gets at the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis: that language can alter our perception of reality. Another example of this is that the Inuit language has many words for snow, so they‚Äôre much better at interacting with and navigating snow than we are, with our singular word for it. Furthermore, it‚Äôs clear that humans can imagine more than they could have before we invented language. From fictitious monsters, such as ghosts, zombies, vampires, and dragons, to heady concepts such as black holes and utopias, we live in a world full of ideas that simply couldn‚Äôt survive in our minds for very long without the words and grammar we‚Äôve created to sustain them. Language has already molded us. It seems very plausible to me that we could develop our language in order to mold us in a new direction.

We have already done as much before. With the invention of numbers and mathematics, we flooded our language with new symbols that require a completely different kind of education to understand. In tandem, we cultivated the field of logic, which has some neat new symbols but uses a lot of the olds ones too. In doing so, we‚Äôve conquered something that we now call *data*. Now, I know you know what data is, but I want to share with you a new definition I use for it.

**Data** refers to the class of information that can be measured.

A measurement can be a quantity or category that describes *anything* by comparing it to some reference point. Like a pound of silver. What you probably take for granted is that, by measuring something, you can now share that information with someone else. You cannot do this with qualia.

**Qualia** refers to the class of information that can be experienced. 

An experience is a feeling that is unique to an individual, and not much more can be said about it because words are a type of data. So, wait a second. If data and qualia are separate things, then how do we use data to understand qualia?

While computers input and output data, you and I input and output qualia. Any data that is scrawled across our eyes or ears gets mapped to qualia. That‚Äôs why ‚Äúa sunny meadow‚Äù conjures an image in your head that perhaps has other feelings associated with it. Earthy odors and cut grass. Chirping bugs and birds. Tickling plants. Golden rays. The tannins in a glass of red wine at a picnic. Joy. Peace. Friendship.

If you let those words I wrote soak into your mind, you‚Äôll find yourself in a sort of scene from a story. But, the scene I imagined when writing those words is different from that which you imagined, and any other person who will read this. We all have similar qualia that map to these words, but not identical. What if that is true for more than just these symbols though? Perhaps the word ‚Äúsunny‚Äù invokes different qualia in your imagination than mine because you literally experience sunlight differently than me. This may raise a question: how much may our experiences be different?

Philosophy calls this the Inverted Qualia problem. In short, it gets at is a question like, ‚Äúwhat if my red is your green, but we just call them the same thing?‚Äù Fortunately, inverted qualia does not threaten how we interact with data. So, the world will still go around. But, it exposes how useless language is at sharing qualia. I acknowledge this because we don‚Äôt need to use language to share qualia. We need to use language to understand what qualia are, how they‚Äôre generated, and how to share them. The fact that we have a word for qualia means we‚Äôre on the right track. We can acknowledge that qualia exists. 

It‚Äôs sort of like the classic joke where two fish are swimming, and one says to the other, ‚ÄúHey, the water feels nice today.‚Äù The other responds, ‚ÄúWhat the hell is water?‚Äù Well, when something is constantly around you, and there‚Äôs no alternative, it‚Äôs unlikely that you‚Äôll come up with a name for it. And without a name, how can you even think about it?

We have a name, and that‚Äôs a great start.

## Building Blocks

This is how we can use words (data) to understand qualia. By naming concepts that we can all understand, we can make it easier for our minds to process problems pertaining to these concepts. I mean, if I had to replace every instance of the word ‚Äúqualia‚Äù in this essay with an exhaustive description of what it is and how it works, this essay would be impossible to follow. But naming is helpful for more than just making ideas more concise. It also influences how we see the world. Every new word we conceive of increases our list of things we agree are real. In philosophy, this list is called an ‚Äúontology‚Äù. At the risk of being dunked on by better philosophers, I‚Äôll avoid that term in this essay though. The point is that naming makes our thoughts more efficient, and our worldview more rich. 

So, we must start solving the qualia problem by creating building blocks. Simple names. Qualia is the first. What are some others?

Well, many nerds, like me, have already set out to name related phenomena. I‚Äôm impressed by the glossary that was assembled by the Qualia Research Institue. The most useful word I believe they‚Äôve accounted for is ‚ÄúValence‚Äù which simply refers to how good or bad an experience feels. Roughly speaking, pleasurable experiences have a positive valence, while painful experiences have a negative valence. Neutral experiences have a negative valence. The reason that valence is a better term than ‚Äúpain‚Äù or ‚Äúpleasure‚Äù is because it defines a spectrum that these facets of experiences sit on, and that spectrum also contains more vague concepts like ‚Äúcomfortable‚Äù or ‚Äúuncomfortable‚Äù, or ‚Äúpeaceful‚Äù and ‚Äúboring‚Äù. It gives us a new axis to compare different instances of qualia on. This also helps us begin to break down qualia into abstract components beyond the specific senses that they map to, such as taste, touch, sight, etc.

On that train of thought, I‚Äôd like to put forth two more terms. Homoqualia, and metaqualia.

Homoqualia refers to qualia that map directly to the homunculus. If you don‚Äôt know, the homunculus is a visual model of a human body that has been warped so that highly sensitive areas are larger then less sensitive parts. So, the eyes, ears, nose, mouth, hand, and reproductive parts are all very large, while the limbs and abdomen are much smaller. The purpose of this term is to categorize ‚Äúsimple‚Äù qualia, such as red, the note A#, the smell of lavender, the taste of chocolate, the feeling of a hot shower, and more. Each of those qualia can be mapped to a body part. A sense organ. Eyes, ears, nose, mouth, skin, etc. The alternative to this is metaqualia.

Metaqualia are the experiences of other qualia. For example, a hot shower may provide you relief or relaxation. All thoughts are also qualia. It‚Äôs worth noting that you can have metaqualia of other metaqualia. For example, you may uncomfortable with how much you like something, or curious about why you‚Äôre sad about something. It may also be apparent to you that valence is only relevant to metaqualia. Even a sensation like the pain of a needle may provide high or low valence depending on the context, for it could pertain to acupuncture or a vaccination. The homoqualia is the sensation of a needle piercing your skin, while the metaqualia is the pain or pleasure associated with it.

So far, our building blocks are: Qualia, valence, homoqualia, and metaqualia. 

These building blocks fail to cover a crucial facet of experience though: focus. If you‚Äôve practiced meditation, you‚Äôll recognize how necessary this is. One of the most fundamental aspects of being conscious is what I‚Äôve heard meditation teachers call ‚Äúthe spotlight‚Äù. This spotlight is always turning and wobbling, illuminating all the different qualia that you experience. But, it doesn‚Äôt necessarily move at random. Meditation is the practice of training your ability to move this spotlight towards that which you want to point it at.

To dive into this concept, I‚Äôd like to introduce the term: Flow.

## Flow

The term comes from a scientist with an incredible name: [Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi). It‚Äôs described as the experience of immersion. Total focus and absorption into the present moment by way of feeling fully engaged by some activity. I‚Äôve had it described to me as the experience you have when you‚Äôre given a task that you‚Äôre adequately challenged by but also capable of solving. Perhaps you‚Äôve felt it when playing a sport or a musical instrument, or maybe while having a good conversation, or grinding at work. 

I believe the concept of flow can be stretched into something more broad though. In my experience, there are varying levels of flow states. Sometimes I‚Äôll be so immersed in programming that I‚Äôll forget to eat. Sometimes I‚Äôll be reading a book that‚Äôs completely drawn me in, but I still get distracted every once in a while. And sometimes, I hop in and out of focus while working on something, to my own dismay.

I‚Äôd call these varying levels of flow ‚Äúviscosity‚Äù. For the uninitiated, viscosity refers to how quickly a substance flows, so syrup has a high viscosity because it‚Äôs sticky and slow to pour, while oil has a low viscosity because it‚Äôs slippery and moves quickly. If we map this to mental states, we can intuit that a focused flow state has a low viscosity, because it provides lots of clarity and feels easy to move through. Meanwhile, an unfocused flow state feels slow and confusing, and even obstructing, which is why I‚Äôd describe it as having a high viscosity. 

So, we add two more building blocks: Flow, and viscosity. 

But, you may wonder why I‚Äôve chosen these obscure terms, rather than just use something like ‚Äúfocus‚Äù or ‚Äúawareness‚Äù. Well, in short, I believe these terms support the assumption that there is some sort of spotlight in our heads which we control. Focus sounds acute, whereas flow sounds collective. This is significant because qualia are collectively aware. When you are in a low viscosity flow state, it is because there is a harmony in the collective qualia that make up your mind. This distinction is important to me because I don‚Äôt believe there is any other substance in our conscious mind other than qualia. The qualia collectively form something, from which flow emerges. I call this a gestalt.

## Gestalts and Curation

Generally, the term ‚Äúgestalt‚Äù refers to something that is greater than its parts. 

I‚Äôd like to repurpose the term in this context to refer to the way in which qualia pool together to form awareness. 

As I said, I don‚Äôt believe there is a spotlight. I believe, based on my own internal observations, that each quale illuminates itself, and can perhaps illuminate others. This is because the nature of ‚Äúexperience‚Äù entails attention. To focus on something is just to experience it more potently.

Now, at any moment, there is a pool of homoqualia and metaqualia swimming in and out of your mind. Homoqualia are spawned directly due to the sense organs in your body, while metaqualia are continuously generated both as reactions to these homoqualia and as reactions to other metaqualia. So, when we think of our ‚Äúspotlight‚Äù, what we‚Äôre really ascertaining is that, whenever we focus on a specific facet of our reality, what‚Äôs happening is that all of the qualia in the pool are directing their ‚Äúlight‚Äù towards one another. A focused flow state can be imagined as a circle of qualia all pointing their ‚Äúlight‚Äù towards a single quale. Meanwhile, a highly viscous flow state can be imagined as a disorganized pool of qualia pointing at various targets. 

It is this collective illumination that simulates our spotlight. That‚Äôs why I care about the term, gestalt. At any moment, you are shifting your focus to and from different homoqualia and metaqualia, but ‚Äúyou‚Äù are actually just the gestalt that emerges from these homoqualia and metaqualia illuminating each other. 

Crucially, this ‚Äúillumination‚Äù actually plays some role in the generation of metaqualia. Try it out right now. Focus on something random in your room. You‚Äôll soon find your mind sprouting thoughts about that thing. For me, I looked at a remote. My mind for some reason thought about all the germs from touching it, as well as some other fleeting thoughts. So, if you have a similar experience, then you can verify this assertion: flow generates metaqualia. 

This is actually potentially useful to you in terms of daily life. Personally, it helped me learn how to deal with intrusive thoughts. Specifically because I learned that my mind generates thoughts that are similar to those that I pay a lot of attention to. So, if I stop paying a lot of attention to scary thoughts like ‚Äúwhat if I broke this thing‚Äù, then I will stop having that thought as often. It may be common sense, but it‚Äôs actually quite helpful with respect to mental health at large. Because you can‚Äôt control what thoughts appear, but you can start to influence the system that generates them by curating better thoughts. That‚Äôs what I call ‚Äúcuration‚Äù. 

The metaphor I use for curation is that we‚Äôre like a curator in an art museum, but the staff don‚Äôt speak the same language. So, we can‚Äôt tell them to take down certain paintings, or which kind of paintings we want them to put up, but we notice that when we stare at certain paintings for a while, the staff will pick up on that and find more paintings like that one. Similarly, if they notice we never stare at certain paintings, they‚Äôll take those down and avoid putting up paintings like them.

This is how you make choices. This is literally the crux of your free-will, and therefore, your identity. 

You are the gestalt generated by this pool of qualia flowing together. 

Let‚Äôs recap our building blocks now: Qualia, valence, homoqualia, metaqualia, flow, viscosity, gestalt and curation.

There‚Äôs one issue with this model though. Qualia are not discrete. We can talk about a ‚Äúquale‚Äù in the same way that we can talk about a drop of water, as opposed to apples and oranges. You cannot *just* have a red experience. You are viewing splotches of reds mixed with other colors, at varying shades, in varying locations, and contrasted by everything else in your other sensory channels like what song you‚Äôre listening to our what your room smells like. So then, how does this awareness work if it‚Äôs distributed across a continuous mixture of experiences?

This is a question that I think we‚Äôll only be able to answer with more inquiry. We need to train our minds towards this way of thinking. We need more terms. It‚Äôs a mind bending concept, this non-spatial pool of qualia mixing together, undulating in waves of flow, and reproducing even more qualia as the old qualia seems to evaporate somehow. It‚Äôs at this point that I ask myself: how valid are these assertions I‚Äôm even making?

## Internal Empiricism

When it comes to devising strategies for making sense of the world, science and mathematics are focused on empirical or analytical strategies. This is to say that they like conclusions that are derived from measurable observations, or conclusions derived from an extremely rigorous set of axioms and actions (math and logic). One happens in your head. One happens outside your head. But, both can be verified outside of your head. 

I‚Äôd like to broaden our methods by proposing that we don‚Äôt just focus on observing things that are measurable using physical tools. I know that we can observe our own qualia. That‚Äôs what metaqualia is, and as I‚Äôve established, most qualia is metaqualia. So, it follows that if we can put names to certain patterns of metaqualia and then compare these descriptions with eachother, we can get somewhere. Perhaps you agree with some of what I‚Äôve said about homoqualia, metaqualia, or curation. Maybe you agree with all of it, or maybe it‚Äôs all garbage to you. 

**I don‚Äôt know** whether other people will relate to this. I need your feedback though. We all need it, because we can use it. We can achieve a lot more in the study of consciousness if we start to embrace some of this and make a new system for working on the qualia problem.

## Why should I care again?

Listen, you don‚Äôt have to care. I can‚Äôt say this‚Äôll help you directly accomplish your goals. But, it may help you indirectly, and it will also help all of us if we‚Äôre more tapped into it collectively.

I‚Äôd like to call this field of inquiry, ‚Äúqualiatics‚Äù. 

If we cultivate this field, there are a whole lot of untapped opportunities waiting for us to apply our newfound qualia literacy to them. How about politics? Perhaps people would feel like the world is less divisive if we found ways to make it easier to share our experiences. Perhaps we would trust each other more then. How about art? If we can tap into the ways in which our brains generate qualia, there‚Äôs a whole lot of mind-bending potential to exploit. Some innovative artists could stretch our color qualia such that we begin to see brand new man-made colors. What about religion? Perhaps a better understanding of what qualia is will illuminate other things that are real and not physical. And most importantly, in my opinion, we can develop real tools for addressing mental health that aren‚Äôt as physically or financially expensive. The field of psychology is at the peak of a replication crisis, and now more than ever, we need a revolution in the study of the mind to make progress that‚Äôll actually help people.

To recap, there are three big questions that we really want to get at with qualiatics.

What is qualia?

How is it created?

Can it be shared, and how?

I think these could define three different disciplines within the field. There‚Äôs so much to tackle and I haven‚Äôt explored it all yet. I believe my ideas about curation and gestalts can inform us on the mechanism of generating qualia, and it‚Äôs possible that applying the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis to this problem will be the first step in figuring out how to share this all, but I definitely still don‚Äôt have the answer to what it is. As far as I‚Äôm concerned, it could be an electro-magnetic wave, or it could exist in the aether along with the number three, or god. 

My only agenda is to say this: we have a lot ahead of us.

In my mind, where we are now is like where humanity was right as it began to invent language, or math, or science. We‚Äôve been acquiring the pieces to make the tools for a while, but we still don‚Äôt quite know what we‚Äôre building yet. And that is exhilarating. I often felt like I was growing up in a world where so much of the unknown had already been uncovered, and that the only important problems left to solve were all locked behind expensive science equipment and academic bureaucracy. Well no more. To revolutionize qualiatics, all you need is your own mind, and a way to write.

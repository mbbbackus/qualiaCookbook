First of all, if you don't know what qualia is:

<Nest>👩‍🔬 What is Qualia?|qualia<Nest>

## How do we crack it?

What does it mean to crack it? Well, we know qualia exists. We have plenty examples of it. But, we have no idea how it connects to “the real world”. The physical world. We have no idea what creates qualia, or how. We have no idea how to share it, or if thats possible. These are some of the issues we ought to explore, just to start.

This has been called “the hard problem of consciousness” by David Chalmers. That name is, perhaps, an understatement. My philosophy professors generally told me that this problem is impossible. As did my peers. As have I believed, on occasion. 

Many of my conversations about qualia overloaded my brain until I just wanted to watch dumb youtube videos and eat chips in bed. 

It’s hard to wrap your head around itself.

However, there are other opinions. In the world of artificial intelligence, prominent figures in AI and AI alignment (such as Sam Altman and Eliezer Yudkowsky) tend to believe that an AI will simply generate qualia one day once its programming is complex enough. Meanwhile, the Qualia Research Institute (led by **[Andrés Gómez Emilsson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andr%C3%A9s-g%C3%B3mez-emilsson-b3084539))** holds that Qualia is a byproduct of the way our brains interact with electric fields. Alternatively, one of the most academically respected opinions would be that of Daniel Dennett, who contends that qualia is not real. He argues it’s an illusion and that we’re distracting ourselves by getting into this.

I could dissect and debate these arguments, but I won’t, because I believe that’d be less interesting than what I have to say. 

I think it’s possible to crack qualia. I think it’s possible, but not with machine learning, nor with brain surgery, nor magic. But, to be clear: I have not cracked qualia. I still don’t have the answers to any of the questions I raised. I have a new idea for how to get them though. I believe our minds are currently incapable of figuring out how qualia works. But, we can massage and sculpt our minds into ones that can. To do that, we can use language. 

## Linguistic Engineering

Did you know that Russian-speakers can see blue better than English speakers? Russian has more words for different shades of blue, therefore Russian speakers have an advantage at differentiating those shades of blue. Famously, the blockbuster movie *Arrival* (based on a story by Ted Chiang) uses a similar premise for its story–spoiler incoming–where an alien species teaches humanity a language which is atemporal, so it enables its speakers to experience reality in four dimensions, such that time is simultaneous.

This gets at the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis: that language can alter our perception of reality. Another example of this is that the Inuit language has many words for snow, so they’re much better at interacting with and navigating snow than we are, with our singular word for it. Furthermore, it’s clear that humans can imagine more than they could have before we invented language. From fictitious monsters, such as ghosts, zombies, vampires, and dragons, to heady concepts such as black holes and utopias, we live in a world full of ideas that simply couldn’t survive in our minds for very long without the words and grammar we’ve created to sustain them. Language has already molded us. It seems very plausible to me that we could develop our language in order to mold us in a new direction.

We have already done as much before. With the invention of numbers and mathematics, we flooded our language with new symbols that require a completely different kind of education to understand. In tandem, we cultivated the field of logic, which has some neat new symbols but uses a lot of the olds ones too. In doing so, we’ve conquered something that we now call *data*. Now, I know you know what data is, but I want to share with you a new definition I use for it.

**Data** refers to the class of information that can be measured.

A measurement can be a quantity or category that describes *anything* by comparing it to some reference point. Like a pound of silver. What you probably take for granted is that, by measuring something, you can now share that information with someone else. You cannot do this with qualia.

**Qualia** refers to the class of information that can be experienced. 

An experience is a feeling that is unique to an individual, and not much more can be said about it because words are a type of data. So, wait a second. If data and qualia are separate things, then how do we use data to understand qualia?

While computers input and output data, you and I input and output qualia. Any data that is scrawled across our eyes or ears gets mapped to qualia. That’s why “a sunny meadow” conjures an image in your head that perhaps has other feelings associated with it. Earthy odors and cut grass. Chirping bugs and birds. Tickling plants. Golden rays. The tannins in a glass of red wine at a picnic. Joy. Peace. Friendship.

If you let those words I wrote soak into your mind, you’ll find yourself in a sort of scene from a story. But, the scene I imagined when writing those words is different from that which you imagined, and any other person who will read this. We all have similar qualia that map to these words, but not identical. What if that is true for more than just these symbols though? Perhaps the word “sunny” invokes different qualia in your imagination than mine because you literally experience sunlight differently than me. This may raise a question: how much may our experiences be different?

Philosophy calls this the Inverted Qualia problem. In short, it gets at is a question like, “what if my red is your green, but we just call them the same thing?” Fortunately, inverted qualia does not threaten how we interact with data. So, the world will still go around. But, it exposes how useless language is at sharing qualia. I acknowledge this because we don’t need to use language to share qualia. We need to use language to understand what qualia are, how they’re generated, and how to share them. The fact that we have a word for qualia means we’re on the right track. We can acknowledge that qualia exists. 

It’s sort of like the classic joke where two fish are swimming, and one says to the other, “Hey, the water feels nice today.” The other responds, “What the hell is water?” Well, when something is constantly around you, and there’s no alternative, it’s unlikely that you’ll come up with a name for it. And without a name, how can you even think about it?

We have a name, and that’s a great start.

## Building Blocks

This is how we can use words (data) to understand qualia. By naming concepts that we can all understand, we can make it easier for our minds to process problems pertaining to these concepts. I mean, if I had to replace every instance of the word “qualia” in this essay with an exhaustive description of what it is and how it works, this essay would be impossible to follow. But naming is helpful for more than just making ideas more concise. It also influences how we see the world. Every new word we conceive of increases our list of things we agree are real. In philosophy, this list is called an “ontology”. At the risk of being dunked on by better philosophers, I’ll avoid that term in this essay though. The point is that naming makes our thoughts more efficient, and our worldview more rich. 

So, we must start solving the qualia problem by creating building blocks. Simple names. Qualia is the first. What are some others?

Well, many nerds, like me, have already set out to name related phenomena. I’m impressed by the glossary that was assembled by the Qualia Research Institue. The most useful word I believe they’ve accounted for is “Valence” which simply refers to how good or bad an experience feels. Roughly speaking, pleasurable experiences have a positive valence, while painful experiences have a negative valence. Neutral experiences have a negative valence. The reason that valence is a better term than “pain” or “pleasure” is because it defines a spectrum that these facets of experiences sit on, and that spectrum also contains more vague concepts like “comfortable” or “uncomfortable”, or “peaceful” and “boring”. It gives us a new axis to compare different instances of qualia on. This also helps us begin to break down qualia into abstract components beyond the specific senses that they map to, such as taste, touch, sight, etc.

On that train of thought, I’d like to put forth some new terms:

<Nest>Protoqualia|protoqualia<Nest>

<Nest>Metaqualia|metaqualia<Nest>

<Nest>Awareness|awareness<Nest>

<Nest>Internal Empiricism|internal_empiricism<Nest>

## Why should I care again?

Listen, you don’t have to care. I can’t say this’ll help you directly accomplish your goals. But, it may help you indirectly, and it will also help all of us if we’re more tapped into it collectively.

I’d like to call this field of inquiry, “qualiatics”. 

If we cultivate this field, there are a whole lot of untapped opportunities waiting for us to apply our newfound qualia literacy to them. How about politics? Perhaps people would feel like the world is less divisive if we found ways to make it easier to share our experiences. Perhaps we would trust each other more then. How about art? If we can tap into the ways in which our brains generate qualia, there’s a whole lot of mind-bending potential to exploit. Some innovative artists could stretch our color qualia such that we begin to see brand new man-made colors. What about religion? Perhaps a better understanding of what qualia is will illuminate other things that are real and not physical. And most importantly, in my opinion, we can develop real tools for addressing mental health that aren’t as physically or financially expensive. The field of psychology is at the peak of a replication crisis, and now more than ever, we need a revolution in the study of the mind to make progress that’ll actually help people.

To recap, there are three big questions that we really want to get at with qualiatics.

What is qualia?

How is it created?

Can it be shared, and how?

I think these could define three different disciplines within the field. There’s so much to tackle and I haven’t explored it all yet. I believe my ideas about curation and gestalts can inform us on the mechanism of generating qualia, and it’s possible that applying the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis to this problem will be the first step in figuring out how to share this all, but I definitely still don’t have the answer to what it is. As far as I’m concerned, it could be an electro-magnetic wave, or it could exist in the aether along with the number three, or god. 

My only agenda is to say this: we have a lot ahead of us.

In my mind, where we are now is like where humanity was right as it began to invent language, or math, or science. We’ve been acquiring the pieces to make the tools for a while, but we still don’t quite know what we’re building yet. And that is exhilarating. I often felt like I was growing up in a world where so much of the unknown had already been uncovered, and that the only important problems left to solve were all locked behind expensive science equipment and academic bureaucracy. Well no more. To revolutionize qualiatics, all you need is your own mind, and a way to write.

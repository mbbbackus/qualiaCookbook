We’re going to try to figure out what qualia is, how to make it, and how to share it. If we succeed, the consequences will be immeasurable, literally. 

Welcome.

## What is this “cookbook” exactly?

Let’s start with why I’ve called this the “Qualia Cookbook”.

Here’s how this website is like a cookbook:

- Its contents could eventually serve as a sort or recipe for making qualia.

Here’s how it’s not like a cookbook: 

- For normal cookbooks, the reader learns the recipe and uses the ingredients to make a beautiful product. For this one, the beautiful product (you) learns the ingredients (our concepts) and uses the recipe (the concept graph) to make a reader (someone who understands what qualia is). So, it’s like a reverse cookbook.
- The entries are not isolated recipes, but rather pieces of a puzzle that contribute to a greater whole.

## Qualia Cookbook Format

Each entry will cover a specific concept. Generally, the goal is to name these entries well which means we should stray away from confusing names and encourage simple and intuitive names. More on this in a later entry.

The website will have the format of a network graph so that users can quickly navigate the tree of ideas and onboard themselves to the cause. There will also be nested article referencing such that, if an article is mentioned by another article, the user can expand that article within the context of the article referencing it.

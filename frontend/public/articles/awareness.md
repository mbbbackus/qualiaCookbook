These building blocks fail to cover a crucial facet of experience though: focus. If you’ve practiced meditation, you’ll recognize how necessary this is. One of the most fundamental aspects of being conscious is what I’ve heard meditation teachers call “the spotlight”. This spotlight is always turning and wobbling, illuminating all the different qualia that you experience. But, it doesn’t necessarily move at random. Meditation is the practice of training your ability to move this spotlight towards that which you want to point it at.

To dive into this concept, I’d like to introduce the term: Flow.

The purpose of the term "Flow" helps us come to understand two more crucial terms: Gestalt and Curation.
